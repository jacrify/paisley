# TODO
- [ ] Start abstracting, move the Filter Button out as a separate component to centralize it.
- [ ] Change columns to use ghost button
- [ ] Once and for all fix ReactSelect and make it the new class on Rules, Transactions and the Filter. Make it a new class created for the Account Toolbar panel. Let's make that the standard for everything as it has some nice abstractions including options for coloredPills and isCreatable.
- [ ] Add onKeyDown escape propagates all the way up to close the popover.
- [ ] Add string (contains/regex) to Account Filter
